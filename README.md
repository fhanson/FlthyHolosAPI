This is a wrapper library for sending I2C and Serial commands to the Flthy Holoprojectors.
Documentation for the FlthyHPs can be found here https://www.2geekswebdesign.com/FlthyHPs/Manual/FlthyHPsManual_v1.8.pdf

This Libary is intended to be used in conjunction with other projects like Padawan360 to control Holoprojector lights and servo animations. Note: Servo animations will only work if they are connected to the Flthy board, not if the servos are connected to a Marcduino board.
